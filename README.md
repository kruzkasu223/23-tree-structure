# 23/27-tree-structure

This project is all about creating a tree structure component that allows users to visually organize and navigate hierarchical data. (but it'll be just static demo, due to time constraints)

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/).
